# Unity60FPS
iOS Jailbreak Tweak that force Unity Games render at custom framerate. 

## What is this
* Some games will always render at 30FPS or only render at 60FPS in battle scene and provide no option about it.
* This Tweak will force those games always render at framerate you provide (typically 60 or 30). 
* Note that not any values is valid. Due to [vsync](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/205824295-Mobile-game-flips-between-running-at-30FPS-and-60FPS), the ultimate framerate will only be 60 or 30. 
* This Tweak is initially made for bgo(fgo in chinese), but it also works on bgo(tw), bcr(pcr in chinese) and some other games made by Unity Engine.

# How to use
* To render at 60 FPS, typically you set the framerate to 60. 
* But on some devices, you may find that 45 is a better value. I don't know the reason, but it works. 
 
# Warning
* Due to the way it works, hooking directly to game engine, use this Tweak AT YOUR OWN RISK.
